# Original Internet Speed Checker — UI Template
Purpose: A standalone, client-side UI demo for designers/developers to reuse.
Scope: UI-only — no backend, no analytics, and no data collection built in.
Usage: Drop `index.html` (and `speed.gif`) into any static site or open locally.
Customization: Edit text, images, and styles freely; keep the visual layout intact if desired.
Accessibility: Includes basic aria attributes; review contrast and alt text for production use.
License: Use and modify freely for demos, prototypes, and internal design libraries.
Distribution: Can be shared with teammates — avoid deploying as a functional service.
Support: File author: ./0xbrxjxth — open issues or PRs on your internal repo.
Security: No user data is stored or transmitted by this template.
Cleanup: Remove any demo assets before using in public-facing projects.
